The ~/static/flask-images directory is where the pubs_ui
application expects to cache images. While in version control,
with the exception of this document, the directory will be
empty. 

The file structure of application should be under
version control as well. Git will not allow a directory
to be committed if it is empty. Hence, this document is here
to allow a critical part of the application file structure
to be under source control. 

Please do not unilaterially remove this file.
